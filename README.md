# 🌾 Edutech - Offline-First AI Learning Platform for Rural Students

## Project Description

Edutech transforms rural education by building an offline-first AI-powered learning ecosystem designed specifically for students in low-connectivity regions. 

Unlike traditional online platforms that depend on continuous internet access, Edutech ensures uninterrupted learning through intelligent offline support, local content accessibility, and lightweight performance optimization.

The platform combines structured learning modules, AI-assisted guidance, and progress tracking systems to create a reliable, inclusive, and accessible digital education environment for rural communities.

Edutech bridges the digital divide by turning every low-cost smartphone into a powerful learning companion.
